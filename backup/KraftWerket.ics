 at One Bowl are offered on a ‘pay what you can’ basis in order to ensu

 that there are no set prices on any of our meals. We provide a suggested d

SUMMARY:[KraftWerket] Fresh Blood
DTSTART:20240921T180000
DTEND:20240921T230000
DESCRIPTION:<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body fie
 ld--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">\n <p>\n  The 
 first edition of Fresh Blood is finally here!!! This event is meant to giv
 e visibility to bands from the Danish metal underground and\, whenever pos
 sible\, having them share the stage with more seasoned bands with a larger
  following so to increase their visibility and allow them to showcase thei
 r talent and make new fans and connections!\n  <br/>\n  This edition of Fr
 esh Blood is not here to fuck around\, setting the heaviness bar quite hig
 h with a mixture of hard rock and heavy and alternative metal\, courtesy o
 f Zen in Noise\, Original Fire and Belief Control.\n </p>\n <h3>\n  PROGRA
 M\n </h3>\n <p>\n  -------------------------------------------------------
 -----------------------------------------------\n  <br/>\n  18:00 - Doors 
 open\n  <br/>\n  19:00 - Pretext\n  <br/>\n  20:00 - Original Fire\n  <br/
 >\n  21:00 - Belief Control\n </p>\n <h3>\n  BELIEF CONTROL\n </h3>\n <p>\
 n  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 -------------------------------\n  <br/>\n  Belief Control critically exam
 ines the dangers inherent in extreme belief systems\, whether they manifes
 t as conspiracy theories\, religion\, cults or other forms. Through their 
 music\, the band highlights the potential consequences for individuals and
  society as a whole\, including societal division\, violence\, and histori
 cal atrocities emphasizing the devastating effects of such actions. Belief
  Control promotes critical thinking and skepticism\, encouraging listeners
  to question and challenge ideas rather than blindly accepting them. By ad
 vocating for intellectual independence\, Belief Control seeks to empower i
 ndividuals to resist manipulation and coercion. Overall\, the themes of Be
 lief Control underscore the dangers of unchecked belief and the importance
  of maintaining a critical perspective in a world where misinformation and
  manipulation are prevalent.\n </p>\n <h3>\n  PRETEXT\n </h3>\n <p>\n  ---
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -------------------------\n </p>\n <p>\n  Pretext is an international Meta
 l/Rock band based in Copenhagen\, Denmark. After releasing an EP and LP as
  a trio\, the band is ready to release a debut 4 tracks EP entitled “For
 ce the Hand of Fate” with the full new line up. Musically\, Pretext aims
  to tear apart the rule books of metal\, grunge and hard rock by creating 
 a hybrid unique sound reflecting the band members influences and vastly di
 fferent backgrounds spanning across Denmark\, Iraq\, Poland\, Hungry and S
 weden. Visceral grooves\, ripping solos and Middle Eastern melodic sensibi
 lities with focus on song dynamics and good song writing practice. Lyrical
 ly\, Pretext is a vehicle to voice grievances with the world and protest a
 ll that which causes suffering\, be it religious hypocrisy\, ultra nationa
 lism\, authoritarianism or even rebelling against the world of darkness wi
 thin. No matter the topic\, the lyrics are always drawn from the band memb
 ers’ own personal life experience.\n </p>\n <h3>\n  ORIGINAL FIRE\n </h3
 >\n <p>\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------
 ---------------------------------------\n </p>\n <p>\n  Established in 201
 8 based on a pure and lifelong relationship with heavy metal. Original Fir
 e is the sound of metal inspired by a wide range of legends such as Judas 
 Priest\, Pantera\, The Cult\, and Anthrax as well as contemporary elements
  from Swedish melodic metal\, French brutality\, and American groove. Ande
 rs Jacobsen's unmistakable and strong vocals are entirely their own\, span
 ning an impressive register that creates Original Fire's catchy hooks and 
 tunes. Nikolaj Christensen handles both the insisting rhythm guitar riffs 
 and the shameless solos. The rhythm section\, consisting of Pitter Bacher 
 on heavier-than-thou bass and Kasper Beck Steensen on pounding drums and c
 razy fills\, drives the songs and grooves forward\n </p>\n</div>\n
