 𝘗𝘢𝘳𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘴𝘦 𝘪𝘴 𝘉𝘶𝘳𝘯𝘪𝘯𝘨 (20
 23) 𝘣𝘺 𝘔𝘪𝘬𝘢 𝘎𝘶𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘧𝘴𝘰𝘯\nIn a w
 orking-class area of Sweden\, sisters Laura (16)\, Mira (12) and Steffi (7
 )\, get by on their own\, left to their own devices by an absent mother. W
 ith summer on the way and no parents around\, life is wild and carefree\, 
 vivacious and anarchic. But when social services call a meeting\, Laura ha
 s to find someone to impersonate their mom\, or the girls will be taken in
 to foster care and separated. Laura keeps the threat a secret\, so as not 
 to worry her younger sisters. But as the moment of truth draws closer\, ne
 w tensions arise\, forcing the three sisters to negotiate the fine line be
 tween the euphoria of total freedom and the harsh realities of growing up.
