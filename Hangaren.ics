DTSTART:20240922T140000
DTEND:20240922T220000
DESCRIPTION:Whrikk's raw\, heavy\, and surprising sets morph through the f
 arther depths of the underground trance scene\, to contemporary techno and
  hardware-drenched productions of his own. Approaching 20 years of genre-b
 ending live-sets around the planet and releasing uniquely crafted trance t
 racks on an extensive list of underground Psytrance labels such as the mys
 tical Sanaton Records in Sweden\, Ezy's 'Tricky Grain' based in Copenhagen
 \, Moon Koradji Records of Ukraine and many more. Since a few years\, Whri
 kk has been branching out more with powerful and trippy techno sets at a f
 ew of the rapidly growing K0L T event series in Amsterdam\, one of the inf
 amous Berlin-based Mala Junta 'Haunted' editions and often touring exotic 
 regions like Brasil and India\, where he dosed at the first India Boiler R
 oom event in Goa. Besides several self-released EP's on his own WHRK Recor
 ds\, his striking productions have also found their way onto Schacke's 'Sa
 cred Interface' imprint\, Mala Junta XAmniote's benefit series\, Berlin-ba
 sed 'Deestricted' and again\, the list goes on. Over the years\, Matthijs 
 has always been demonstrating his diverse musical ambition with several al
 bums under his braindance/lDM/jungle alias 'WHRK'\, catchy synth-pop as 'M
 athi' and melodic house\, weirdo acid and hard-to-define electronics as 'R
 iffa'.   \n\n--  \n\nThe last Sunday open-air daytime event of the season!
  It will take place in our beloved backyard to close the summer by dancing
  in the sun and relaxed atmosphere.  \n\n𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘-𝗨𝗣:  \nWhr

SUMMARY:[Hangaren] FINE CHAOS+Hangaren - 'The Next Chapter': Benwal (NL)\,
  alina\, Esther Urioste\, Mikkel Wonsbek
DTSTART:20240927T230000
DTEND:20240928T060000
DESCRIPTION:Three decades of trance\, rave and techno come together in a c
 ontemporary blend of high-paced\, hypnotizing euphoria. Or\, as Benwal put
 s it: “A 90s vibe with a 20s twist.”\nBenwal is steadily becoming a ho
 usehold name in up-tempo dance music. From his home base Groningen (NL)\, 
 he is currently making waves with a fresh and energetic sound. Winning ove
 r crowds with his infectious DJ performance and solid productions\, he is 
 rapidly gaining traction across Europe.\n\nBenwal’s obsession with elect
 ronic music is deeply rooted in Groningen’s underground. Splendidly capt
 uring the energy of post-pandemic party life\, his rave platform Zeven was
  an overnight success. He also became a resident of KopjeK\, one of the ci
 ty’s longest running and most respected parties. Playing b2b with kindre
 d spirits like Marlon Hoffstadt Malugi and Tjade\, he further perfected hi
 s musical storytelling. Pretty soon\, he performed in clubs like Radion\, 
 Gewölbe Cologne\, Thuishaven and AMP Münster.\n\nAlready supported by th
 e likes of KI/KI\, TRYM and DJ Heartstring\, Benwal’s productions are th
 e latest focal point on his exciting musical journey. Endless hours in the
  studio with his production partner Jonathan Kruizenga are finally paying 
 off. Benwal’s new release is set to come out later this year\, when “N
 ever The Same” – a sought after gem this past festival summer – will
  finally see the light of day. As his sound is evolving towards a bit more
  groove-centered\, trance-influenced style\, this year promises to be quit
 e the rollercoaster.\n\n\n𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘-𝗨𝗣:\n\nBenwal (NL)\nhttps

SUMMARY:[Hangaren] Frida Darko (DE)\, Emma Sø\, Azpecialguest
DTSTART:20241011T230000
DTEND:20241012T060000
DESCRIPTION:Dark\, driving\, uplifting. Slowed down. Frida Darko is living
  proof that ‘bpm’ is no longer the answer to creating high-impact ener
 gy on the dancefloor. Her unique secret weapon comes in the form of danger
 ously dense basslines which rumble through her audience's bones. And in me
 smerizing contrast to her often dark and turbulent sounds\, she steps up t
 o her stage with such contagious joyfulness\, loveable silliness\, and a r
 emarkable sense of humor - all whilst remaining professional to her craft.
  \n\nRaised by the distinctive Rebellion der Träumer* and as a member of 
 the Club-Crew Station Endlos\, she brings her infectious music and energy 
 to a multitude of cities and festivals around europe and further\, where s
 he astonishes the crowd with her deep-driving interpretation of Down & Mid
 tempo. Having her roots nourished at underground parties and alternative f
 estivals\, she is eager to not lose herself to the fastliving-way of the e
 lectronic music scene. And aprt from her studies in nutritional science\, 
 she spends her time either searching for new music\, laying down fresh rec
 ords with her partner in crime Atric\, or reading\, chatting and meditatin
 g with the goal to look for the right balance between excess and a sustain
 able way of living. \n\nUsually with a smile on her face and a funny pun i
 n her pocket\, she strives to fascinate her crowd with tunes of “Darko-n
 ess”. Expect bouncy\, chunky\, dark disco beats that will hit hard\, but
  leave you feeling awakened from the shadows.\n\n𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘-𝗨𝗣

SUMMARY:[Hangaren] Spekki Webu (NL)\, Kasper Marott\, Peachlyfe
DTSTART:20241019T230000
DTEND:20241020T060000
DESCRIPTION:Versatile\, exquisite\, and resourceful - elements that shape 
 the limitless possibilities of master spellbinder Spekki Webu. Hailing fro
 m the unpretentious city of Delft in The Netherlands\, this conceptual sou
 nd composer and artist continues to create an ethereal realm of its own th
 rough multiple artistic outlets. Guided by an ethos gained through his inv
 olvement in the gabber and tekno movement\, Spekki Webu cultivates a sound
  that can be described as persistent and ritualistic. Whether it is his DJ
  sets\, live performances\, or music productions\, the mysterious chief mi
 nd expander deconstructs time and space with fierce precision and tactilit
 y. On a constant quest to explore the unknown\, his studio-binging session
 s resulted in releases on widely respected labels such as Amniote\, Blue H
 our\, and Positive Source.\nMoved by his philosophical beliefs on spiritua
 lism\, Spekki Webu’s output manifests itself beyond the dancefloor with 
 a strong emphasis on multidisciplinary collaboration. His vision of electr
 onic music translated through his Mirror Zone label and Optic Portal subla
 bel. As a composer\, he pushes the boundaries of sound through his Signal 
 Transmutations AV project and multiple spatial installations presented at 
 places such as Lunchmeat\, FIBER\, and De School. While behind the scenes\
 , he works on scores and sound design for movies and series.\nNavigating t
 hrough the crossroads of tribalism\, experiment\, and rhythm - the broad m
 usical spectrum of this lysergic gatekeeper drags you into a wormhole that
  goes beyond the here and now\, captivating listeners into a deep state of
  introspection. Escape the simulated reality as you delve into the unknown
  depths of your mind with Mirror Zone head honcho Spekki Webu.\n\n𝗟𝗜

SUMMARY:[Hangaren]   Hunee (DE)\, Prom Night\, Mari To The Future
DTSTART:20241025T230000
DTEND:20241026T060000
DESCRIPTION:Watching him dj - it’s clear that Hunee has a close relation
 ship with the dancefloor. Here's a DJ who celebrates with the people on th
 e other side of the booth\, taking them on a musical journey that transcen
 ds time and place. There is an explorative energy in his dj sets that is g
 eared towards making each set become its own unique animated being that br
 eathes and pushes forward. Hunee grew up in Bochum\, a former industrial c
 ity in West Germany\, to culturally active parents from South Korea. He mo
 ved to Berlin 3 days after finishing his school education to study and to 
 spend all his time working and digging in record shops\, and djing all aro
 und the blossoming club scene. His fearless approach to playing music from
  all ages and all corners of the world is fueled by an unbounded musical c
 uriosity. His dj sets have taken him all over the world too. And whether h
 e plays all-night in an intimate basement or closes a big festival mainsta
 ge\, his sets maintain a sense of quality and emotionality that turn each 
 one of them into a colorful experience. The Lifetones record label and pla
 tform is a community focused manifestation of Hunee’s musical vision. Hi
 s own productions on labels like Rush Hour\, W.T. and Future Times are as 
 colorful as his character\, displaying a diverse spectrum of his inspirati
 ons. No matter how much they differ from each other\, each Hunee record ha
 s a certain kinked funk\, true sense of soul or loveable house heritage th
 at puts them up there with the best of the rest.\n\n𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘-𝗨
