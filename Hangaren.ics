SUMMARY:[Hangaren] Sunday Psy: Whrikk (NL)\, Matriark\, Goasis\, Uro Gai
DTSTART:20240922T140000
DTEND:20240922T220000
DESCRIPTION:Whrikk's raw\, heavy\, and surprising sets morph through the f
 arther depths of the underground trance scene\, to contemporary techno and
  hardware-drenched productions of his own. Approaching 20 years of genre-b
 ending live-sets around the planet and releasing uniquely crafted trance t
 racks on an extensive list of underground Psytrance labels such as the mys
 tical Sanaton Records in Sweden\, Ezy's 'Tricky Grain' based in Copenhagen
 \, Moon Koradji Records of Ukraine and many more. Since a few years\, Whri
 kk has been branching out more with powerful and trippy techno sets at a f
 ew of the rapidly growing K0L T event series in Amsterdam\, one of the inf
 amous Berlin-based Mala Junta 'Haunted' editions and often touring exotic 
 regions like Brasil and India\, where he dosed at the first India Boiler R
 oom event in Goa. Besides several self-released EP's on his own WHRK Recor
 ds\, his striking productions have also found their way onto Schacke's 'Sa
 cred Interface' imprint\, Mala Junta XAmniote's benefit series\, Berlin-ba
 sed 'Deestricted' and again\, the list goes on. Over the years\, Matthijs 
 has always been demonstrating his diverse musical ambition with several al
 bums under his braindance/lDM/jungle alias 'WHRK'\, catchy synth-pop as 'M
 athi' and melodic house\, weirdo acid and hard-to-define electronics as 'R
 iffa'.   \n\n--  \n\nThe last Sunday open-air daytime event of the season!
  It will take place in our beloved backyard to close the summer by dancing
  in the sun and relaxed atmosphere.  \n\n𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘-𝗨𝗣:  \nWhr
