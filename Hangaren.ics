DTSTART:20240922T140000
DTEND:20240922T220000
DESCRIPTION:Whrikk's raw\, heavy\, and surprising sets morph through the f
 arther depths of the underground trance scene\, to contemporary techno and
  hardware-drenched productions of his own. Approaching 20 years of genre-b
 ending live-sets around the planet and releasing uniquely crafted trance t
 racks on an extensive list of underground Psytrance labels such as the mys
 tical Sanaton Records in Sweden\, Ezy's 'Tricky Grain' based in Copenhagen
 \, Moon Koradji Records of Ukraine and many more. Since a few years\, Whri
 kk has been branching out more with powerful and trippy techno sets at a f
 ew of the rapidly growing K0L T event series in Amsterdam\, one of the inf
 amous Berlin-based Mala Junta 'Haunted' editions and often touring exotic 
 regions like Brasil and India\, where he dosed at the first India Boiler R
 oom event in Goa. Besides several self-released EP's on his own WHRK Recor
 ds\, his striking productions have also found their way onto Schacke's 'Sa
 cred Interface' imprint\, Mala Junta XAmniote's benefit series\, Berlin-ba
 sed 'Deestricted' and again\, the list goes on. Over the years\, Matthijs 
 has always been demonstrating his diverse musical ambition with several al
 bums under his braindance/lDM/jungle alias 'WHRK'\, catchy synth-pop as 'M
 athi' and melodic house\, weirdo acid and hard-to-define electronics as 'R
 iffa'.   \n\n--  \n\nThe last Sunday open-air daytime event of the season!
  It will take place in our beloved backyard to close the summer by dancing

SUMMARY:[Hangaren] FINE CHAOS+Hangaren - 'The Next Chapter': Benwal (NL)\,
  alina\, Esther Urioste\, Mikkel Wonsbek
DTSTART:20240927T230000
DTEND:20240928T060000
DESCRIPTION:Three decades of trance\, rave and techno come together in a c
 ontemporary blend of high-paced\, hypnotizing euphoria. Or\, as Benwal put
 s it: “A 90s vibe with a 20s twist.”\nBenwal is steadily becoming a ho
 usehold name in up-tempo dance music. From his home base Groningen (NL)\, 
 he is currently making waves with a fresh and energetic sound. Winning ove
 r crowds with his infectious DJ performance and solid productions\, he is 
 rapidly gaining traction across Europe.\n\nBenwal’s obsession with elect
 ronic music is deeply rooted in Groningen’s underground. Splendidly capt
 uring the energy of post-pandemic party life\, his rave platform Zeven was
  an overnight success. He also became a resident of KopjeK\, one of the ci
 ty’s longest running and most respected parties. Playing b2b with kindre
 d spirits like Marlon Hoffstadt Malugi and Tjade\, he further perfected hi
 s musical storytelling. Pretty soon\, he performed in clubs like Radion\, 
 Gewölbe Cologne\, Thuishaven and AMP Münster.\n\nAlready supported by th
 e likes of KI/KI\, TRYM and DJ Heartstring\, Benwal’s productions are th
 e latest focal point on his exciting musical journey. Endless hours in the
  studio with his production partner Jonathan Kruizenga are finally paying 
 off. Benwal’s new release is set to come out later this year\, when “N
 ever The Same” – a sought after gem this past festival summer – will
  finally see the light of day. As his sound is evolving towards a bit more
  groove-centered\, trance-influenced style\, this year promises to be quit
 e the rollercoaster.\n\n\n𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘-𝗨𝗣:\n\nBenwal (NL)\nhttps

SUMMARY:[Hangaren] Frida Darko (DE)\, Emma Sø\, Azpecialguest
DTSTART:20241011T230000
DTEND:20241012T060000
DESCRIPTION:Dark\, driving\, uplifting. Slowed down. Frida Darko is living
  proof that ‘bpm’ is no longer the answer to creating high-impact ener
 gy on the dancefloor. Her unique secret weapon comes in the form of danger
 ously dense basslines which rumble through her audience's bones. And in me
 smerizing contrast to her often dark and turbulent sounds\, she steps up t
 o her stage with such contagious joyfulness\, loveable silliness\, and a r
 emarkable sense of humor - all whilst remaining professional to her craft.
  \n\nRaised by the distinctive Rebellion der Träumer* and as a member of 
 the Club-Crew Station Endlos\, she brings her infectious music and energy 
 to a multitude of cities and festivals around europe and further\, where s
 he astonishes the crowd with her deep-driving interpretation of Down & Mid
 tempo. Having her roots nourished at underground parties and alternative f
 estivals\, she is eager to not lose herself to the fastliving-way of the e
 lectronic music scene. And aprt from her studies in nutritional science\, 
 she spends her time either searching for new music\, laying down fresh rec
 ords with her partner in crime Atric\, or reading\, chatting and meditatin
 g with the goal to look for the right balance between excess and a sustain
 able way of living. \n\nUsually with a smile on her face and a funny pun i
 n her pocket\, she strives to fascinate her crowd with tunes of “Darko-n
 ess”. Expect bouncy\, chunky\, dark disco beats that will hit hard\, but
  leave you feeling awakened from the shadows.\n\n𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘-𝗨𝗣
