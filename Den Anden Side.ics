SUMMARY:[Den Anden Side] Mycelium x Omen Wapta @ Den Anden Side
DTSTART:20240921T235900
DTEND:20240922T025900
DESCRIPTION:Mycelium x Omen Wapta @ Den Anden Side on September the 21st:\
 n\nOnce again\, we are expanding the mycelium network. For the fifth expan
 sion\, our fungal threads are stretching all the way to the Netherlands to
  absorb nutrients from the multidisciplinary artistic platform Omen Wapta.
  Led by Woody92\, Omen Wapta is a record label\, fashion brand\, art platf
 orm\, and much more. Characterized by shamanistic warp-speed techno\, blur
 ry trance reflections\, and earthy abstract minimalism\, it is a perfect m
 atch for a mushroomy mycelium night.\n\nJoining Woody92 are two of his tru
 sted label mates: Loek Frey for a DJ set and Floid for a live performance.
  To fulfill the brain-stimulation\, we’re pairing them with two prominen
 t figures from the Copenhagen scene: Sham and Matriark. The latter will jo
 in Woody92 for a rare closing back-to-back set.\n\n\nLINEUP:\n\nWoody92 b2

 u-21-floid-23042023\n\nSham (she/her)\nhttps://soundcloud.com/stardust-evn
 /sham-stardust-mix-07\n\n\nWOODY92\nAs a DJ\, Woody92’s expertly curated
  and characteristic sets deviate from the norm\, exploring psychoactive st
 rains of leftfield electronics\, hypnotic techno\, and radiant minimalism.
  His pristine yet unpredictable mixes have already left a unique musical f
 ootprint\, establishing a quietly defiant reputation as a musical curator 
 with increasingly rare depth and focus.\n\nLOEK FREY\nLoek Frey is among t
 he most exciting talents to have emerged from the Dutch scene in recent ti
 mes. His unique blend of IDM\, techno\, breakbeat\, and drum & bass has tu
 rned many heads\, especially with his Decipher album on Omen Wapta. His ab
 ility to veer from the intricate and experimental to the hallucinatory and
  vibrant is second to none.\n\nFLOID\nFloid is a Delft-based producer and 
 digital sound artist. Letting go of specific genres or ideas\, he takes an
  intuitive approach to electronic music production. Rather than building t
 oward a peak\, he creates endless rhythms and active narratives\, elevatin
 g each other through surprising intervals. Floid's live performances are p
 hase-shifting\, rain-danceable\, and filled with strong psycho-pacing stru
 ctures and nocturnal intensities that fill every corner of our own existen
 ce.\n\nMATRIARK\nCopenhagen-based producer & DJ\, Matriark has justifiably
  earned her spot in the global clubbing scene. Her music productions and D
 J sets reflect the 90s and 00s trance era while incorporating elements of 
 modern Scandinavian forest psytrance. Her work encapsulates everything in 
 beautiful\, sentimental melodies.\n\nSHAM\nSham is a Copenhagen-based arti
 st with Syrian origins. Known for her impeccable focus and presence behind
  the decks\, she consistently provides suggestive\, ever-flowing grooves b
 eneath hypnotic atmospheres. With a versatile yet specific hypnotic sound 
 that blends old school and modern techno and trance\, her sets take listen
 ers on a deep journey.\n\n–\n\nABOUT MYCELIUM\nMycelium is the undergrou
 nd network that forms the root system of fungi. It absorbs nutrients from 
 the environment and sends electrical signals to mushrooms\, functioning si
 milarly to the human brain. Through a series of events\, Den Anden Side ai
 ms to grow an underground network that connects the creative energies we s
 ee emerging across the globe. We hope our mycelium network can thrive in t
 he soil of electronic music and provide nutrients to all the little fungi 
 on the scene.\n\n_________\n\nENTRANCE\n150 DKK\n2 for 1 before 00:30\n80

SUMMARY:[Den Anden Side] Axces x DAS Presents: Kia (AU) & OCCA (JP)
DTSTART:20241004T235500
DTEND:20241005T025500
DESCRIPTION:Axces Recordings is proud to present another full takeover of 
 Den Anden Side. This time we have Kia\, OCCA\, and Sørine joining us for 
 an adventurous night across the two floors. \n\nDen Anden Side:\n00:00 - 0
 3:00 	Kia (he/him)\n03.00 - 06:00 OCCA (she/her)\n06:00 - end 	Søren Kinc
 h (he/him)\n\nDen Anden Ende:\n01:00 - 03:00	 Martin Gilleshøj (he/him)\n
 03:00 - 05:00	 Sørine (she/her)\n05:00 - end 	 Popmix b2b Alfredo92 (he/h
 im\, he/him)\n	   \nKia has a taste-making ear for digging\, sophisticated
  knack for storytelling and bubbling energy that draws people to her wheth
 er she’s backstage\, behind the decks or on the dance floor. As label bo
 ss of Animalia and Cirrus\, she is a Naarm/Melbourne local who’s one of 
 the influences driving organic\, kaleidoscopic shades of electronic music 
 around the world. Behind the decks\, she’s a master of playing to her su
 rroundings\, in a context-driven connection of time\, space and sound. Her
  decidedly community driven approach to her Animalia platform has created 
 a global network of forward-thinking producers. Kia’s sense of curiosity
  underpins all of her output and drives her ability to throw curveballs in
 to the mix with instinct\, confidence and energy.\nwww.soundcloud.com/kia-
 sydney \n\nOCCA has been organising ARCHIV for over 10 years at the sacred
  club\, Precious Hall in Sapporo\, located in the northernmost region of J
 apan\, Hokkaido. With his own party ARCHIV at the core\, he has been expan
 ding his scope of activities from all over Japan to the rest of the world.
  As an entity of singularity\, he aims to transform time/space/spirit into
  unknown realms by arranging multifaceted elements such as the spiritualis
 m of Psychedelic Music\, the storytelling nature of House Music\, the sci-
 fi dystopian feel of Detroit Techno and the trance of Minimal Music in a t
 hree dimensional way through his deft mixing. \nwww.soundcloud.com/oooccaa
 a   \n\nSørine will also join the lineup sharing some of her favourite ho
 use and progressive tunes. \nhttps://soundcloud.com/soerine \n\nAxces DJs\
