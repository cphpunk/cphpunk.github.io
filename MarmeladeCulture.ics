SUMMARY:[MarmeladeCulture] Songwriters Night At Operaen
DTSTART:20240919T190000
DTEND:20240919T235900
DESCRIPTION:\n\n\nOn September 19th\, Operaen invites to a Songwriters Eve
 ning\, with performances from some of the most talented artists in the sce
 ne today.\n\n\nABOUT THE ARTISTS\n\n\n\nSOPHIE JULLY\n\n\nIn a world where
  we often get lost in noise and superficiality\, young artist appears\, ar
 med with a voice which tears us out from the shallow and into the core of 
 strong emotions.\n\n\n\nANYMORE\n\n\nANYMORE is a Copenhagen based group\,
  formed in 2024 by the leadsinger JAMZZ and the producer PHATFACE. Their s
 tyle can be described as funky\, disco hard hitting tunes that combines el
 ements of sampling old soul grooves elements into new danceabel hits.\n\n\
 n\nJOSIAH BARRETT\n\nHailing from the coastlands of Tidewater Virginia\, J
 osiah's music is steeped in the American roots tradition. With influences 
 ranging from Country\, Gospel\, Blues\, and others\, you are sure to move 
 to the rhythmn and soul of Josiah's songs.\n\n\n\nSANASEY \n\nHii! I’m S
 ana\, I’m 25 years old from CPH Denmark. I go by the name sanasey\, and 
 I am a big sucker for RNB and Neo-Soul\, so naturally that’s what I make
 . \nI love creating and I love preforming. I’ve been singing ever since 
 I can remember\, and I genuinely feel like I breathe music. I would classi
 fy my music as soothing RNB tunes packed with harmonies and emotion\, and 
 I can’t wait for you all to hear my inner thoughts. I hope you will foll
 ow along in my journey as a new upcoming artist.\n\n\n\nTREE HOUSE COLORS 
 https://fb.watch/udHS5hRCWU/\n\nTree House Colors play high-tempo protest 
 rock songs alongside dreamy melodies about love and existence.\n\nThe band
  comprise the elegant and innovative Røskva on drums\, beat poet and rhyt
 hm guitarist songwriter Mat\, lead guitar and melody maker Jacob\, and bas
 s maestro Jan.\n\nTheir live sets are noisy\, visceral and emotional. They
  enjoy to give it their all for the audience.\n\n\n\nTIYER\n\nTiyer is a C
 openhagen based composer drawing upon many genres in his music\, pulling t
 he listener into a dreamy yet energetic world of stories\, dynamic express
 ion and surprises\, where a longing for hope\, love and unity is a recurri
 ng theme\, in a versatile musical landscape where truthful expression is p
 rioritized over anything else. The music is a approached as an open canvas
  where the only goal is meaningful exploration of reality\, and where the 
 idea of "good" and bad" music doesnt exist. Tiyer began his career as a mu
 sician in the Copenhagen electronic music scene\, creating communities aro
 und experimental music with other producers\, with new concepts such as El
 ectronic Jams and Mics that up until that point had only been seen in the 
 UK. This debut was well recepted\, and within a short timespan catapulted 
 its creators into the entire Copenhagen music scene\, teaming up with fell
 ow Zealots from the songwriter scene\, Jazz scene\, Poetry Slam\, demo and
  impro scene. Tiyer is currently working on music for several video game t
 itles to be released next year\, and has worked on concerts\, releases and
  workshops with a string of legendary musicians such as Elias Bendix\, Tob
 ias Trier\, Malene Mortensen\, Rikke Bjerre\, Hannah Muir\, Niklas Timmer 
 Kristensen\, Laust Eberhardt Bonnesen\, Jesper Pyskow\, Daniel Carlos Gold
 field\, Frederik Moth\, Frederik Hjulmand\, Christopher And The Lost Binoc
 ular\, Mucky Kid and Normal Original\, Ulrik Lindgren\, Monika Banyte\,\, 
 Bjarke Treufeldt\, Oscar Schjerbeck\, Pernille Isedora and the list contin
 ues. Tiyer is also working as a booker and arranger for unique and innovat
 ive show concepts\, such as "Forest Concerts" a concept created by multi-m
 usician Oscar Schjerbeck\, and personalised private concerts with pop acts
  like Tim Schou. Lately Tiyer has been focusing on personal\, introspectiv
 e songwriting\, and will this night be combining that work with an eclecti
 c set of different styles.\n\n\n\n\n\n
