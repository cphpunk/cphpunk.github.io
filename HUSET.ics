 N G G E R is a traveling musical family\, made up of Pan-Asian couple\, IT
 TA (from South Korea) and MARQIDO (from Japan)\, who create their brand of
  psychedelic New-Age drone magic through the use of Voice\, Indian harmoni
 um\, and Toy instruments (played by ITTA) and synths &amp\; electronics (p
 layed by MARQIDO).\n </p>\n <p>\n  The duo originally started out with the
  moniker “10” but since the birth of their son RAAI (who joins them on
  tour and playing Voice\, Synth\, Toy Instrument\, Dance performance on st
 age) in 2012\, have called themselves TENGGER (meaning ‘unlimited expans
 e of sky’ in Mongolian) to mark the expansion of the\n  <br/>\n  <br/>\n
   family. It also means ‘huge sea’ in Hungarian.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Trave
 l\, as spiritual experience in real environments\, and the sound between t
 he space and the audience have been central themes of their works. The fam
 ily’s yearly pilgrimages inform every aspect of their art.\n </p>\n <p>\
 n  Pitchfork: "From field recordings to Krautrock to something they call '
 aural hang-gliding'\, TENGGER have truly begun to put their stamp on psych
 edelic music."\n </p>\n <p>\n  Uncut Magazine: "There's a level of detail 
 in TENGGER's music that sets them apart from other drone artists\, sounds 
 nimbly woven together rather than painted in broad brushstrokes."\n </p>\n
  <p>\n  Bandcamp Daily: "...like stepping through a glowing portal and gas
 ping at the wonders of another world”\n </p>\n <p>\n  Stereogum: "Their 
 shimmering synthesizers and reverberant chants invoke the most ethereal en
 d of krautrock..."\n </p>\n</div>\n

  presents an evening of live music at Musikcaféen in Copenhagen on Friday
  13th September.\n  <br/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Tomas Bodén is a revered figure
  of the aural murk\, known primarily for his work as Civilistjävel. It’
 s an alias that has spawned a catalogue of self-released peculiarities\, f
 eaturing music that scorns traditional form\, instead opting for unfussed 
 symphonies of ice-hued minimalism\; soft murmurs that emanate from his stu
 dio in the High Coast of Sweden.\n  <br/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  soccer Committee
  is the solo project of Dutch artist\, Mariska Baars. She grew up in the c
 ountryside of The Netherlands listening to the magical sounds of the river
  near her childhood home. These peaceful\, organic sounds have made their 
 way into her music. Her style is often described as a natural\, unforced b
 lend of experimental\, folk\, ambient and electronics\, created with elect
 ric guitar\, voice and effects.\n  <br/>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Thommy Wahlström
  is a Swedish composer and musician educated in Composition/EAM at the Got
 land School of Music Composition and the Royal College of Music in Stockho
 lm. Wahlströms music is often a combination of acoustic and electroacoust
 ic music. In recent years\, he has been concentrating on combining traditi
 onal notation with an ”alternative representation of sound and music”\
 , which refers to the development of graphic scores.\n </p>\n</div>\n

 " was released\, with hits like "Trains &amp\; Buses\," "Always Friday\,"

SUMMARY:[HUSET] Skammens vogn – Spacebaby releasekoncert | Musikcaféen
DTSTART:20241116T200000
DTEND:20241116T230000
DESCRIPTION:<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body fie
 ld--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">\n <p>\n  Skam
 mens vogn — consisting of poet-priest Nikolaj Zeuthen\, healer Oliver Ho
 iness\, and cannabis farmer Jakob Millung — celebrates the essence and d
 own-to-earth appeal of rock music on their new album\, Spacebaby. This is 
 the trio's eighth release\, and they'll mark the occasion with a concert a
 t Huset\, performing alongside a brand-new live ensemble. Experience Skamm
 ens vogn like you've never heard them before!\n </p>\n <p>\n  The album ti
 tle\, Spacebaby\, comes from the chorus of their single "Kim Larsen er dø
 d" and is actually a hidden Kim Larsen quote. It refers to a traveler in o
 uter space who passes beyond time and transforms back into a fetus. For th
 e band\, music is a spiritual phenomenon not bound by time or place\, and 
 the spacebaby symbolizes this: "Infant\, elder\, warrior – idiot\, sage\
 , vagabond\, showman – street sweeper\, astronaut – past\, present\, a
 nd forever – this is the call and voice of music\, which we strive to an
 swer to the best of our ability."\n </p>\n <p>\n  Skammens vogn is a group
  founded on a friendship from their elementary school days\, an artistic a
 nd spiritual collective that has now existed for nearly twenty years. The 
 band broke through with the album Asfalt (2013). Zeuthen has been nominate
 d twice for the Carl Prize for his lyrics and once for the Steppeulven awa
 rd. Oliver Hoiness has received a Steppeulv award for "Musician of the Yea
 r\," and Jakob Millung has earned several awards for his work with other b
 ands.\n </p>\n</div>\n

DESCRIPTION:<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body fie
 ld--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">\n <p>\n  Klau
 s Johann Grobe are a Swiss duo who often sing in German and have their roo
 ts in a vintage Krautrock style\, using bass\, synths\, and drums to craft
  a sound both familiar and modern. After the release of their first LP\, I
 m Sinne der Zeit\, in 2014\, they expanded their vintage-leaning sound to 
 incorporate disco and chillwave (on 2016's Spagat der Liebe) then R&amp\;B
  and soft rock (on 2018's Du Bist So Symmetrisch) before moving into even 
 more relaxed\, cinematic songwriting with hints of jazz fusion on their me
 lancholic fourth album\, 2024's Io Tu il loro.\n </p>\n <p>\n  «Io tu il 
 loro» is a record that cannot be done by endlessly fiddling around with h
 undreds of ideas and sounds. All it needed was a real break (Dani and Sevi
  didn’t work on any Grobe related stuff until they met up in the mountai
 ns in 2022).\n </p>\n <p>\n  It’s an album with a blurry vision and soft
  limitations. You can somehow feel them looking back on all their work for
 givingly and then moving on to what felt right.\n </p>\n <p>\n  So here we
  are with nine tracks full of embracing warmth\, so melancholicly welcomin
 g you don’t know if you want to smile or cry. Some might call it timeles
 s\, some might call it dad-rock... well\, it certainly isn’t disco for t
 he masses\, it’s more like\, «If I can’t make myself dance after four
  beers\, I can as well go home.»\n </p>\n <p>\n  So\, no disco? No syncop
 ated synths? No German? No reverb? Where’s The Grobe?\n </p>\n <p>\n  Ta
 ke your time\, you’ll notice Klaus Johann Grobe aren’t gone\, they jus
 t took a turn before driving yet into another unknown\n </p>\n</div>\n

  2020 following the pandemic\, and Talk Show was more than ready to let th
 eir creativity flow in a restriction-free world:\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p>

  almost oversaturated post-punk scene.\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Effigy
 \, Talk Show's long-awaited debut album\, offers a bold and exciting showc
 ase of the band's dramatic evolution\, drawing on influences from The Chem
 ical Brothers and The Prodigy to Nine Inch Nails and KLF\, as they hit a r
 aw\, primal sound at the intersection of techno\, electronic\, industrial\
 , and rock music.\n </p>\n <p>\n </p>\n <p>\n  The result is an immersive\

DESCRIPTION:<div class="clearfix text-formatted field field--name-body fie
 ld--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden field__item">\n <p>\n  Chop
 per is a dark and playful solo project by Jonatan K. Magnussen (former fro
 ntman of The Love Coffin)\, based in Copenhagen\, Denmark. Kejser embraces
  both the glamorous and the grotesque\, believing that it is in the clashe
 s between these extremes that stories emerge\, and reality reveals itself.
  Now\, you can experience them together in a double concert at Xenon.\n </
 p>\n <p>\n  <strong>\n   Chopper:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  In defiance
  of what we expect from a typical pop star and with a flair for the absurd
  and bizarre\, Chopper’s music spans everything from eurodance to glam r
 ock\, heavy industrial to disco – Chopper himself calls it ‘Shock-pop.
 ’\n </p>\n <p>\n  In its 3-year existence\, Chopper has gained wide reco
 gnition for its intense live shows\, enigmatic music videos\, and expressi
 ve attitude. Chopper draws from old-school horror films and synthetic bu
 bblegum pop – but don't be fooled: beneath it all lies a gut-wrenching\,
  desperate\, and heart-wrenching force that’s impossible not to be capti
 vated by!\n </p>\n <p>\n  Chopper dances on the fine line between tragedy 
 and comedy. Imagine a carnival from hell\, a vivid nightmare\, the sound o
 f untamed youth\, and a deep yearning for love\; an elegant yet contrastin
 g portrayal of even the darkest corners of existence.\n </p>\n <p>\n  <str
 ong>\n   Kejser:\n  </strong>\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kejser has performed a numbe
 r of shows in Copenhagen at venues like Loppen\, Lille Vega\, Frigjort Fes
 tival\, and even an exclusive showcase in Brooklyn\, New York. This spring
 \, Kejser also took the stage at this year’s SPOT Festival.\n </p>\n <p>
 \n  GAFFA wrote about the concert: "I am nothing less than moved to tears
 … With childlike innocence\, everything melts together into a band you c
 an fully surrender to. It is truly life-affirming to discover music that c
 ontains so much heartfelt goodness."\n </p>\n <p>\n  Most recently\, Kejse
 r performed at this summer’s UHØRT Festival.\n </p>\n <p>\n  In Novembe
 r '23\, Kejser released their debut album Drømmen på Plakaten\, produced
  in collaboration with star producer Anders Boll (Ganger\, Lowly\, among o
 thers). "The band debuts with a sound so distinctively Danish\, it almost 
 becomes exotic" – GAFFA (4 stars)\, while also comparing the band to ico
 nic figures like C.V. Jørgensen. "Original\, unique\, and defining for it
 s time" – Side33.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Kejser was nominated for the GAFFA Awa
 rds '24 as New Danish Artist of the Year and New Danish Pop Release of the
  Year.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Nothing is done halfway when Kejser takes the stage
 \, delivering their quirky and sensual pop music with full force.\n </p>\n
