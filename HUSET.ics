DESCRIPTION:We at Nonstop Feeding The Kitty would like to explore intimacy
 \, time\, and food. We are focused on microwaves\, ready-made meals\, and 
 the communal meal. Through this residency\, we aim to investigate: what ha
 ppens to the gastronomic experience when mutual presence is lacking? We wi
 sh to explore what it does to us when we allow ourselves to give time and 
 love to the food and let the food embrace us like a warm hug. A ritual or 
 a communal meal over which we gather\, where love\, time\, and gratitude a
 re the essence. What is the communal meal without these concepts?We want t
 o investigate where the presence has disappeared to if it is neither found
  around the dining table nor in the intimate. We do not believe it has van
 ished\, but we would like to find glimpses and moments where presence is e
 vident and highlight it.In cooperation with Playwrighter: Trine ThostrupMu

DESCRIPTION:T E N G G E R is a traveling musical family\, made up of Pan-A
 sian couple\, ITTA (from South Korea) and MARQIDO (from Japan)\, who creat
 e their brand of psychedelic New-Age drone magic through the use of Voice\
 , Indian harmonium\, and Toy instruments (played by ITTA) and synths & ele
 ctronics (played by MARQIDO).The duo originally started out with the monik
 er “10” but since the birth of their son RAAI (who joins them on tour 
 and playing Voice\, Synth\, Toy Instrument\, Dance performance on stage) i
 n 2012\, have called themselves TENGGER (meaning ‘unlimited expanse of s
 ky’ in Mongolian) to mark the expansion of thefamily. It also means ‘h
 uge sea’ in Hungarian.Travel\, as spiritual experience in real environme
 nts\, and the sound between the space and the audience have been central t
 hemes of their works. The family’s yearly pilgrimages inform every aspec
 t of their art.Pitchfork: "From field recordings to Krautrock to something
  they call 'aural hang-gliding'\, TENGGER have truly begun to put their st
 amp on psychedelic music."Uncut Magazine: "There's a level of detail in TE
 NGGER's music that sets them apart from other drone artists\, sounds nimbl
 y woven together rather than painted in broad brushstrokes."Bandcamp Daily
 : "...like stepping through a glowing portal and gasping at the wonders of
  another world”Stereogum: "Their shimmering synthesizers and reverberant
  chants invoke the most ethereal end of krautrock..."

DESCRIPTION:In celebration of the release of Civilistjävel!'s new album B
 rödföda\, FELT presents an evening of live music at Musikcaféen in Cope
 nhagen on Friday 13th September. Tomas Bodén is a revered figure of the 
 aural murk\, known primarily for his work as Civilistjävel. It’s an ali
 as that has spawned a catalogue of self-released peculiarities\, featuring
  music that scorns traditional form\, instead opting for unfussed symphoni
 es of ice-hued minimalism\; soft murmurs that emanate from his studio in t
 he High Coast of Sweden. soccer Committee is the solo project of Dutch ar
 tist\, Mariska Baars. She grew up in the countryside of The Netherlands li
 stening to the magical sounds of the river near her childhood home. These 
 peaceful\, organic sounds have made their way into her music. Her style is
  often described as a natural\, unforced blend of experimental\, folk\, am
 bient and electronics\, created with electric guitar\, voice and effects.
  Thommy Wahlström is a Swedish composer and musician educated in Composi
 tion/EAM at the Gotland School of Music Composition and the Royal College 
 of Music in Stockholm. Wahlströms music is often a combination of acousti
 c and electroacoustic music. In recent years\, he has been concentrating o
 n combining traditional notation with an ”alternative representation of 
 sound and music”\, which refers to the development of graphic scores.

DTSTART:20240914T200000
DTEND:20240914T230000
DESCRIPTION:Anna Maehl:With her playful productions and intimate vocals\, 
 Danish producer and singer Anna Maehl creates an art pop universe of her o
 wn. In 2023 Anna Maehl was selected for the Belgian radio contest De Nieuw
 e Lichting (earlier finalists count Tamino and The Haunted Youth) with her
  first single Youth Song. Same year Youth Song was featured in the Belgian
  youth series Knokke Off (VRT\, Netflix Global) and she played her concert
  debut at the Danish showcase UHOERT. In June 2024\, she released her seco
 nd single Carolyn\, released on French label La Taniere. Ninna Lundberg:"
 When Lundberg's crystal-clear and soulful vocals\, along with the band's p
 henomenal harmonies\, are introduced\, every hair on my arms stands on end
 ... I am completely absorbed by the music. It's ambient yet folk-like. It 
 sounds simultaneously bleak and like a beautiful spring morning. It's poet
 ic and truly touching. So touching\, in fact\, that I shed a little tear."
 From GAFFA review of Ninna Lundberg and band at Northern Winter Beat 2023.
 After great success with the band Ganger\, Ninna Lundberg released her deb
 ut album "Two Two of You" in 2022. The album is a collection of experiment
 al songs and personal narratives carried by her sensitive and raw vocals\,
  set against a backdrop of dusty piano melodies and dynamic brass and stri
 ng arrangements.In live performances\, Ninna collaborates with saxophonist
  Viktor Kongsbak\, double bassist Thorbjørn Kaas\, and musician/singer Mi
 lle Mejer Djernæs Christensen. Together\, they perform songs from Ninna's
  debut album alongside new material enveloped in beautiful\, organic arran
 gements that effortlessly traverse between the grandiose and atmospheric a
 nd the very close and intimate.

 iers is made up of a tightly knitted and loud gang of five consisting of t
 he members Dan Hoff\, Emmet White\, Ben O’Neill\, Mark MacCormack and Pi
 erce Callaghan who have managed to refine the art of being both friends\, 
 roommates and colleagues all at once.  During the last two years the Gur
 riers have expanded on their dangerously addictive sound\, which have culm
 inated in two singles\, opening gigs for Goat Girl and Enola Gay and sold 
 out shows at the famous London club Brixton Windmill.  The band describe
 s their live shows as unruly\, loud and turbulent\, driven by a suppressed
  need to perform during their long stay in their rehearsal space under the
  pandemic.  We are ready for Gurriers blowing off the roof of Huset! Are
  you?

 g-awaited cinematic debut album "Opbrud\," and is going on an autumn tour 
 in November\, where she will perform the album in its entirety with her li
 ve band behind her.Charlotte-Amalie's music is known for its cinematic pop

  personal stories. Through the album's total of 10 songs\, "Opbrud" depict
 s a constant struggle between understanding and accepting oneself in the f
 ace of life's trials. Despite the dark moments\, the thread of hope and op
 timism shines through and invites the listener on an emotional excursion t
 hat both explores and challenges."The album is a raw and honest story abou
 t life's ups and downs\, and the realizations and values ​​you learn a
 s you get older and get to know yourself. It is a disruption of the old\, 
 and a description of the process in creating a new starting point. The lyr
 ics move from self-observation and self-insight to optimism and hope\, and
  embrace both the bright and dark sides of life\, where light gets its mea
 ning from darkness" says Charlotte-AmalieAfter giving samples of the album

SUMMARY:[HUSET] Klaus Johann Grobe (CH)
DTSTART:20241119T200000
DTEND:20241119T210000
DESCRIPTION:Klaus Johann Grobe are a Swiss duo who often sing in German an
 d have their roots in a vintage Krautrock style\, using bass\, synths\, an
 d drums to craft a sound both familiar and modern. After the release of th
 eir first LP\, Im Sinne der Zeit\, in 2014\, they expanded their vintage-l
 eaning sound to incorporate disco and chillwave (on 2016's Spagat der Lieb
 e) then R&B and soft rock (on 2018's Du Bist So Symmetrisch) before moving
  into even more relaxed\, cinematic songwriting with hints of jazz fusion 
 on their melancholic fourth album\, 2024's Io Tu il loro.«Io tu il loro»
  is a record that cannot be done by endlessly fiddling around with hundred
 s of ideas and sounds. All it needed was a real break (Dani and Sevi didn
 ’t work on any Grobe related stuff until they met up in the mountains in
  2022).It’s an album with a blurry vision and soft limitations. You can 
 somehow feel them looking back on all their work forgivingly and then movi
 ng on to what felt right.So here we are with nine tracks full of embracing
  warmth\, so melancholicly welcoming you don’t know if you want to smile
  or cry. Some might call it timeless\, some might call it dad-rock... well
 \, it certainly isn’t disco for the masses\, it’s more like\, «If I c
 an’t make myself dance after four beers\, I can as well go home.»So\, n
 o disco? No syncopated synths? No German? No reverb? Where’s The Grobe?T
 ake your time\, you’ll notice Klaus Johann Grobe aren’t gone\, they ju
 st took a turn before driving yet into another unknown
