 - Belief ControlBELIEF CONTROL--------------------------------------------
 ----------------------------------------------------------Belief Control c
 ritically examines the dangers inherent in extreme belief systems\, whethe
 r they manifest as conspiracy theories\, religion\, cults or other forms. 
 Through their music\, the band highlights the potential consequences for i
 ndividuals and society as a whole\, including societal division\, violence
 \, and historical atrocities emphasizing the devastating effects of such a
 ctions. Belief Control promotes critical thinking and skepticism\, encoura
 ging listeners to question and challenge ideas rather than blindly accepti
 ng them. By advocating for intellectual independence\, Belief Control seek
 s to empower individuals to resist manipulation and coercion. Overall\, th
 e themes of Belief Control underscore the dangers of unchecked belief and 
 the importance of maintaining a critical perspective in a world where misi
 nformation and manipulation are prevalent.PRETEXT-------------------------
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ---Pretext is an international Metal/Rock band based in Copenhagen\, Denma
 rk. After releasing an EP and LP as a trio\, the band is ready to release 
 a debut 4 tracks EP entitled “Force the Hand of Fate” with the full ne
 w line up. Musically\, Pretext aims to tear apart the rule books of metal\
 , grunge and hard rock by creating a hybrid unique sound reflecting the ba
 nd members influences and vastly different backgrounds spanning across Den
 mark\, Iraq\, Poland\, Hungry and Sweden. Visceral grooves\, ripping solos
  and Middle Eastern melodic sensibilities with focus on song dynamics and 
 good song writing practice. Lyrically\, Pretext is a vehicle to voice grie
 vances with the world and protest all that which causes suffering\, be it 
 religious hypocrisy\, ultra nationalism\, authoritarianism or even rebelli
 ng against the world of darkness within. No matter the topic\, the lyrics 
 are always drawn from the band members’ own personal life experience. O
 RIGINAL FIRE ------------------------------------------------------------
 ------------------------------------------Established in 2018 based on a p
 ure and lifelong relationship with heavy metal. Original Fire is the sound
  of metal inspired by a wide range of legends such as Judas Priest\, Pante
 ra\, The Cult\, and Anthrax as well as contemporary elements from Swedish 
 melodic metal\, French brutality\, and American groove. Anders Jacobsen's 
 unmistakable and strong vocals are entirely their own\, spanning an impres
 sive register that creates Original Fire's catchy hooks and tunes. Nikolaj
  Christensen handles both the insisting rhythm guitar riffs and the shamel
 ess solos. The rhythm section\, consisting of Pitter Bacher on heavier-tha
 n-thou bass and Kasper Beck Steensen on pounding drums and crazy fills\, d
 rives the songs and grooves forward
