DESCRIPTION:Last time the band took to the stage of Råhuset\, it was cele
 brating the release of their debut-EP "The Issue"\, and the venue was full
 . Now\, nearly a year later\, they return with swedish supports Astro-Lloy
 d and Second Wind to play a show for the lonely\, the lovelorn\, lovers of
  beer and lovers of music.\n\n    Early Bird Presale: 100 DKK (+fee)\n

 ys Pl. 7\n\nLoksmith writes songs for you who feels alone and wrong in a w
 orld where groups are increasingly polarised\, and your attention and self
 -worth are bought and sold.\nThe band reaches out from Hillerød\, Denmark
 \, and reminds you that are not alone in these feelings - and that the sol
 ution is an inherent love for life.\n\nLoksmith’s musical journey began 
 in 2019 when Bastian Hobbs (Guitar\, Vocals)\, Malte Andersen (Bass)\, Val
 demar Hansen (Drums) and William Nielsen (Guitar\, Backing vocals) met at 
 Tølløse Privat-\, og Efterskole and quickly started writing songs togeth
 er.\nThe band’s sound is based in guitar-led rock\, and is recognisable 
 by cascading arpeggios\, thumping rhythms\, huge dynamic shifts\, and mela
 ncholic vocals that spiral into hysterical falsetto.\n\nIn 2021\, the band
  made it to the Danish finale of music competition Emergenza Festival. Thi
 s introduced them to the Danish live scene as a tenacious and contagiously
  energetic group and proved one thing true: The real Loksmith experience i
 s in-concert. They've since been playing to active crowds all over Copenha
 gen's underground rock scene\, starting moshpits and waving smartphone fla
 shlights.\n\nIn November 2023\, Loksmith released their debut-EP "The Issu
 e". The EP covers a wide range of sounds\, going from stadium ballads to u
 nrequited love songs without breaking your immersion\, and serves as the b
 and’s first big step in their career as rockstars.\n\nhttps://open.spoti
 fy.com/artist/2xSkiwnfvaalElMVTOV1Yt?si=aYGD2Kj-SsqQvaMEn6THVw\n\nEmerging
  from the late 2010's Stockholm underground scene\, Second Wind has become
  somewhat of a classic wherever cheap beer and college students can be fou
 nd. By fusing elements of alt and indie rock with flowery church piano or 
 heavy\, fuzzed basslines\, they have created their own brand of powerful g
 loom rock which\, coupled with melancholic lyrics and vocals\, echoes the 
 sort of resigned "party at the end of the world" sensation felt by young p
 eople all over the world today.\n\n-\n\nFrom their beginnings\, rehearsing
  in a cramped\, leaking attic studio in Stockholms artist quarters\, to so
 ld out basement bar gigs\, college festivals and musical competitions\, Se
 cond Wind has maintained their steady drum beats and guitar driven undergr
 ound sound while experimenting with everything from feedback noises to sax
 ophones. The wide span of musical influences causes every song to be simul
 taneously unique and vaguely familiar.\n\nAfter finishing their 2022 fall 
 tour\, with a supporting gig for Junior Brielle\, and as winners of Liding
 ö Rock\, a new album combining tour hits with new material is in the work
 s. Along with a loyal and growing fanbase everywhere there is a university
  bar\, this means that Second Wind will continue to be a pulsating musical
  presence at underground venues all over Sweden and beyond.\n\nhttps://ope
 n.spotify.com/artist/2MaZtWQK0XFfVPOnx6IKC1?si=-_FeISJoTj6DUJR58cMrdw\n\n-
 \n\nAstro-Lloyd is all about the love for music. The band is constantly se
 eking to widen their musical horizon by using inspiration from a variety o
 f genres to create a unique sound and delivers energetic live performances
 . The biggest influences are found in Biffy Clyro’s lust to experiment a

 Christian Frigaard\nChristian Frigaard er en 20-årig dansksproget indie-p
 op-artist\, der med sin personlige musik står bag lyden af den upolerede 
 ungdom. Hans selvskrevne numre er taget ud fra egne oplevelser og udfordri
 nger\, som han hudløst ærligt åbner op omkring. \n\nDen unge singer-son
 gwriter har en autentisk lyd og et nærværende tekstunivers\, der ringer 
 genklang i ørerne på en generation\, som længes efter ærlige fortælli
 nger. Med andre ord er han den nye alternative pop-stjerne\, du ikke vil g
 å glip af!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=61551677773093\nhttps

 ▄\n\nStilla Havet (SE)\nStilla Havet fra Stockholm består af Elias Erik
 sson (vokal og guitar) og August Borg (synth). De er kendt for deres mørk
 e og melankolske synthpop\, som er inspireret af 80'ernes new wave og post
 -punk. \n\nBandet har siden 2016 med debutalbummet ”Början på ett slut
 ” været garanter for atmosfæriske lydbilleder\, introspektive tekster 
 og en følelse af nostalgi. Stilla Havet har opbygget en dedikeret interna
 tional fanbase\, især blandt dem\, der værdsætter dyb lyrik og stemning
 sfuld musik med et retro-twist.\n\nMed det seneste album\, ”Natten”\, 
 i rygsækken tager new wave gruppen på tour og stopper i København den 1
 3. september!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/stillahavetmusik\n\n\nOndskyld\nOn
 dskyld er et sekspersoners rockband fra København. Musikken ligger mellem
  gør-det- selvpunk og storslået poprock-ballade med vægt på nuancerede
 \, sjove\, inderlige og relaterbare sange på dansk. Fra punken er der en 
 dyb kærlighed til højt energiniveau og til at gøre tingene forkert. San
 gene er overvældede\, klodsede\, introspektive\, hektiske\, romantiske\, 
 kærlige\, sentimentale\, poetisk flyvske\, hyper konkrete\, sjæl- og sor
 gfulde - Ondskyld kommer det hele i blenderen. Livets helt store følelser
  og kedelige detaljer bliver til en grovkornet smoothie af afmagt\, humor 
 og optimisme. \n\nBandet har netop udgivet break-up EP’en ’Hjertesorg 
 Sommerrock 2024’\; en håndfuld av- mit-hjerte rock-slaskere live-tracke
 t direkte på kassettebånd der beskriver en rigtig ensom lortesommer. Ond
 skyld har de sidste par år markeret sig på scenen med en del airplay af 
 singlen ’Kundeservice’\, et interview i DEBUT på P6 BEAT og en række
  nærværende koncerter rundt om i landet. Sidste efterår var de i studie
 t og indspille debutalbummet ’Fuld Affekt’\, hvorfra første single er
  lige på trapperne. \nhttps://www.facebook.com/ondskyld
